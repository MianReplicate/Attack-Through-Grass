## ü§î Why should you choose this over other similar mods?
- Always updated to latest versions of MC!
- Available on all popular modloaders!
- No dependencies needed (Not even Fabric API for Fabric)
- Minimal amount of code and not intrusive (The mod is one mixin with one inject method)

## ‚ùì FAQ
- Does this work for other blocks other than grass?
  - Yes! Any non-collidable block should work. Non-collidable meaning that the blockstate given has no collision. E.g. portals, open trapdoors, single layer snow.
- Sometimes I still break blocks when attacking mobs!
  - You likely missed your attack. If you can show video proof of this happening, I will look into it.

## üëè Credits
