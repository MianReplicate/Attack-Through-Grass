## ü§î Why should you choose this over other similar mods?
- Always up to date with latest versions of Minecraft.
- Available on all popular modloaders!
- No dependencies needed at all, drop and play
- As mentioned above, it's a client side mod! No need for the server owner to download the mod.
  - As said earlier however, this can be considered **cheating**, so ensure that you inquire a higher up beforehand.
- Minimal amount of code and not intrusive (The mod is one mixin with one inject method)
  - Because of this, I can confidently say that the mod will likely work on newer versions of Minecraft even without a direct port.

## ‚ùì FAQ
- Does this work for other blocks other than grass?
  - Yes! Any non-collidable block should work. Non-collidable meaning that the blockstate given has no collision. E.g. portals, open trapdoors, single layer snow.
- Sometimes I still break blocks when attacking mobs!
  - You likely missed your attack or on an outdated version of the mod. 2.0.2+ versions of the mod have a line of code to delay the player from accidentally breaking a block only if they hit an entity.
- Will the mod work for versions of Minecraft not listed?
  - Usually yes for mod versions 2.+ and Minecraft versions 1.20.5+. The mod is made with almost little to no code which makes it automatically compatible with most upcoming versions of the game (including snapshots!). If you find that the mod does not work, report it to [GitHub](https://github.com/MianReplicate/Attack-Through-Grass)!
